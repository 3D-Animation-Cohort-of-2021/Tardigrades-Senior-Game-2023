# UVU AGD Senior Game
Welcome to the project, we hope you're excited to be here. There is going to be a lot of work to do, and this wiki is here to help you get started the right way.

The goal of this wiki is to concisely help you understand the ways we are using Github for this project, how to get the project set up on your device, and how to navigate the workflow we are using. Nothing here is meant to be complicated, and the more you use it the simpler it will seem.
